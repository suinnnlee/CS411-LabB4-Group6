For our project, we choose to React as our front-end technology stack. Angular and React are both popular choices for the front end. We choose React.js because it is easy to learn, has many reusable components, and has a large and active community. Compared to React, Angular has a steep learning curve. And we choose Flask as our backend framework because it is flexible and easy to understand and use. We think Django could be more bloated for small projects than Flask. And for the database, we choose MongoDB over MySQL because of MongoDB's simplicity and ease of installation and setup, and we don't need a relational database.
