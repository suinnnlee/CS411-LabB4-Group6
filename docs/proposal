Our project will be a website that looks at song artists that the user listens to and creates a ranking of most listened to artists and music genres. 
Then, it will find upcoming concerts and events in the US that the user might like. We will use the Spotify API and Discovery API from TicketMaster. 
The user will need to log in using their Spotify account.
